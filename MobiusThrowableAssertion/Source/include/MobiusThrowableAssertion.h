 Class that wraps the Objective-C exception handling system for use by Swift tests.

 @c throw() raises an exception that will be cought by an enclosing @c MobiusThrowableAssertion.catch(in:) invocation.
 If an exception is uncaught, the process will crash.

 @note Since Swift doesnâ€™t have a concept of exception unwinding, this will generally result in memory leaks.
